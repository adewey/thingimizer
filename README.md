# thingimizer

a thingy to help you work on other thingies. it uses a weighted random system and you can adjust the weights manually if you like

simple usage:

create a `weights.json` file in the `resources` folder

make it match the `Thingies` type (it's an object with string keys and integer values)

eg:

```json
{
  "3d printer": 1,
  "thingimizer": 1
}
```
